# Bellybutton Biodiversity
## Project Overview
Belly button swabs from volunteers were cultured and the bacterial species were identified. The volunteer demographic data and the bacterial culture data were assembled, and displayed in this dashboard.

## Charts
#### Bar Chart
A bar chart was created that displays the top 10 bacterial species in each donor's bellybutton.
#### Bubble Chart
A bubble chart was created that displays the bacterial ID (OTU ID) and the sample values as the y axis value and marker size.
#### Gauge Chart
A gauge chart was created that indicated the donor's belly button washing frequency.

## Customizations:
- An image was added to the jumbotron
- A custom font with color contrast was added to the jumbotron
- Background colors were added to the Test Subject ID selection pane, and the demographic info pane
- The webpage was made to be mobile-responsive
- The belly button washing frequency was put next to the demographic info panel.
